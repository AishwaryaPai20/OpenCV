negative assertion failure means that the video/phot cant be accessed at that specific location or the video ran out of frames.

video can be accessed using frames and capture and once done we use capture.release and destoryAllWindows

cv.resize() resizes the frame to a particular dimension

dtype="uint8" basically an image the dataype of an image

By sending the blur instead of image we can reduce the edge cascade

In Resize function
the interpolation can ve set to cv.INTER_AREA
if the image is larger and we have to shrink it to a specific dimension

else we can set the interpolation to cv.INTER_LINEAR or cv.INTER_CUBIC
if the image is smaller and we have to enlarge it to a specific dimension

In translation function
-x ---> left
-y ---> right
x  ---> right
y  ---> down

In Flipping function the flipCode can be
0 flipping it vertically
1 flipping it horizintally
-1 flipping it both vertically and horizontally

In contours and hierrarchies

hierrachy means hierarhial represnetation of the Contours

retr list returns all the contours presnt in the Image
chain_approx_none how we want to dispaly the Contours
some people use chain_Approx_simple which will compress all the quantities that are returned

Threshold
looks at the image and binarize that image
so if a particular pixel is below 125 it sets to zero or Blank
and if the pixel is over 125 it is set to white or 2/5


Better way would be to use canny and blur for contours rather than threshold method

In averaging process
it computes the average of all of the running pixel intensity values

In gaussian blur each intensity is given a certain weight and is much more natural

In median blur is more effective ,reduces noise as it uses median rather than the Average

Thresholding is the binarization of the image
