negative assertion failure means that the video/phot cant be accessed at that specific location or the video ran out of frames.

video can be accessed using frames and capture and once done we use capture.release and destoryAllWindows

cv.resize() resizes the frame to a particular dimension

dtype="uint8" basically an image the dataype of an image

By sending the blur instead of image we can reduce the edge cascade

In Resize function
the interpolation can ve set to cv.INTER_AREA
if the image is larger and we have to shrink it to a specific dimension

else we can set the interpolation to cv.INTER_LINEAR or cv.INTER_CUBIC
if the image is smaller and we have to enlarge it to a specific dimension

In translation function
-x ---> left
-y ---> right
x  ---> right
y  ---> down

In Flipping function the flipCode can be
0 flipping it vertically
1 flipping it horizintally
-1 flipping it both vertically and horizontally
